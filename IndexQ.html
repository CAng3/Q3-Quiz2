        <td>ahmadz839: Although there is much to praise about the film, "All Quiet on the Western Front" is ultimately hampered by its drawn-out length, the plot dragging in spots, and several confusing moments. All the pieces were in place for "All Quiet on the Western Front" to be the best picture of the year, and in some respects, it is.<p></p>

        <td><p>ThereelscoopwithKK:The movie takes its time walking the audience through the major stages of his life and from my knowledge is quite historically accurate.</p> <p>As for the entertainment value it doesn't pack the same punch as the fictional Creed movies and the fight scenes lack the flare of those in Creed or Rocky , but the movie is not as much about Foreman's boxing career solely as it is more about the man's journey through life.</p>
